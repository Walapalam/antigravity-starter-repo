# Debugging Skill

## Description
This skill helps you systematically identify and fix bugs in code by following proven debugging methodologies.

## When to Use
- When investigating reported bugs
- When tests are failing
- When code behaves unexpectedly
- When tracking down performance issues

## How to Use
1. **Reproduce the issue**: Understand the exact steps to trigger the bug
2. **Isolate the problem**: Narrow down the scope to specific components or functions
3. **Examine the evidence**: Review error messages, logs, and stack traces
4. **Form hypotheses**: Based on evidence, identify potential causes
5. **Test systematically**: Verify each hypothesis one at a time
6. **Fix and verify**: Apply the fix and ensure the bug is resolved

## Debugging Strategies
- Add logging statements to trace execution flow
- Use debuggers to step through code
- Check assumptions about inputs and outputs
- Review recent changes that might have introduced the issue
- Simplify the problem by removing complexity
- Compare working vs. non-working scenarios

## Best Practices
- Document what you've tried
- Don't change multiple things at once
- Keep the original issue in mind
- Test edge cases after fixing
- Consider if similar bugs might exist elsewhere
