# Documentation Skill

## Description
This skill helps you create clear, comprehensive, and maintainable documentation that serves users and developers effectively.

## When to Use
- When creating new features or APIs
- When code behavior is not obvious
- When updating existing functionality
- When onboarding new team members
- When creating user guides or tutorials

## How to Use
1. **Identify the audience**: Understand who will read the documentation
2. **Determine the purpose**: API reference, tutorial, guide, or explanation
3. **Structure content logically**: Organize information in a clear hierarchy
4. **Write clearly and concisely**: Use simple language and short sentences
5. **Include examples**: Show practical usage with code samples
6. **Keep it up-to-date**: Update documentation when code changes

## Documentation Types
- **README**: Project overview, setup instructions, basic usage
- **API Documentation**: Function signatures, parameters, return values
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for common tasks
- **Architecture Docs**: System design and component interactions
- **Contributing Guide**: How to contribute to the project
- **Changelog**: Record of changes between versions

## Best Practices
- Start with the "why" before the "how"
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include code examples that actually work
- Explain assumptions and prerequisites
- Add diagrams for complex concepts
- Link to related documentation
- Test documentation by following it yourself
- Make it easy to search and navigate
- Consider internationalization if needed
- Version documentation alongside code

## Structure Tips
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Add a table of contents for long documents
- Use bullet points and numbered lists
- Highlight important warnings or notes
- Include a "Quick Start" section
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
