# Problem Solving Skill

## Description
This skill helps you approach complex problems systematically, breaking them down into manageable pieces and finding effective solutions.

## When to Use
- When facing a complex technical challenge
- When requirements are unclear or ambiguous
- When multiple solutions are possible
- When you're stuck on a problem
- When planning a new feature or system

## How to Use
1. **Understand the problem**: Define the problem clearly and completely
   - What is the current state?
   - What is the desired state?
   - What constraints exist?
   
2. **Gather information**: Collect relevant data and context
   - Review existing code and documentation
   - Understand related systems and dependencies
   - Research similar problems and solutions
   
3. **Break it down**: Decompose the problem into smaller sub-problems
   - Identify the core issue
   - List dependencies and prerequisites
   - Prioritize what to solve first
   
4. **Generate solutions**: Brainstorm multiple approaches
   - Consider different perspectives
   - Think of edge cases
   - Evaluate trade-offs
   
5. **Choose and implement**: Select the best approach and execute
   - Compare solutions against constraints
   - Start with a simple solution
   - Build incrementally
   
6. **Verify and iterate**: Test the solution and refine as needed
   - Validate it solves the problem
   - Check for edge cases
   - Optimize if necessary

## Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Divide and Conquer**: Break complex problems into simpler parts
- **Work Backwards**: Start from the goal and work back to current state
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for similar problems you've solved before
- **Simplify**: Remove complexity to identify the core issue
- **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explain the problem out loud
- **Ask "Why" Five Times**: Dig deeper to find root causes

## Best Practices
- Don't jump to solutions too quickly
- Question assumptions
- Consider both short-term and long-term implications
- Document your reasoning
- Seek feedback from others
- Learn from failed approaches
- Keep the end user in mind
- Balance perfectionism with pragmatism

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Solving the wrong problem
- Over-engineering the solution
- Ignoring constraints
- Not considering edge cases
- Failing to verify the solution works
- Not documenting the approach
