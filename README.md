# Antigravity Starter Repo 🚀

Welcome to the **Antigravity Starter Repository**! This repository is designed to be your launchpad for building high-performance, agentic AI applications. It comes pre-equipped with a curated collection of **714+ Agentic Skills** to supercharge your AI coding assistants.

## 📦 Included Components

### 1. Antigravity Awesome Skills (Submodule)

The core of this repository is the [`antigravity-awesome-skills`](antigravity-awesome-skills/) directory. To keep things lightweight and maintainable, this is included as a **Git Submodule**.

- **Always Updated**: By using a submodule, you can easily pull the latest updates directly from the source.
- **Comprehensive Catalog**: Refer to the [Internal Catalog](antigravity-awesome-skills/CATALOG.md) for a full list of all 714+ skills.

### 2. Skill Helper

The [`skill-helper.md`](skill-helper.md) file is your curated guide. It organizes the massive skill library into logical "Packs" (e.g., Security, Web Dev, AI Architecture) to help you find exactly what you need for your current task.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the most out of this repository, ensure you clone it recursively to include all skills:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Walapalam/antigravity-starter-repo.git
```

If you've already cloned without submodules, run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## 🛠️ How to Use Skills

Once you have the skills locally, you can invoke them in your favorite AI assistant:

- **Claude Code**: `>> /skill-name help me build...`
- **Cursor**: Use `@skill-name` in the AI chat.
- **Gemini CLI**: `Use skill-name to...`
