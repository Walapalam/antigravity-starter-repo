### Workflow Orchestration in Antigravity

Taking inspiration from established orchestration patterns (like those in early Antigravity research or the `gemini-superpowers` community), we can see high potential in using **Workflows** to formally chain these 714+ skills into seamless routines.

### Proposed Structure

The aim is to complement the existing skill library with a specific directory for orchestration:

```
.agent/
├── rules/              # Core constraints and identity
├── skills/             # The library (SKILL.md files)
└── workflows/          # The routines (Workflow orchestration files)
```

### Role of Workflows

Workflows within this architecture can serve as the "glue" that:

1. **Chain multiple skills together** in a specific sequence
2. **Define preconditions** (e.g., "plan must be approved before execution")
3. **Handle state management** (save artifacts to disk between steps)
4. **Enable complex behaviors** like parallel execution of independent tasks

### Example Workflow Structure

From the reference repository, here's how a workflow file looks:

```markdown
---
description: Executes an approved plan in small steps with verification after each step.
---

# Superpowers Execute Plan

## Preconditions (do not skip)

1. The user must have replied **APPROVED** to a written plan.
2. The approved plan must exist on disk at: `artifacts/superpowers/plan.md`

## Load the plan

- Read `artifacts/superpowers/plan.md`.
- Restate the plan briefly (1–2 lines) before making changes.

## Skills to apply as needed

Read and apply these skills when relevant:

- `superpowers-tdd` (preferred)
- `superpowers-debug` (if issues occur)
- `superpowers-review`
- `superpowers-finish`

## Execution rules (strict)

1. Implement **ONE** plan step at a time.
2. After each step:
   - Run verification command(s)
   - Append results to `artifacts/superpowers/execution.md`
3. If verification fails:
   - Stop and switch to systematic debugging
```

### Benefits for Skill Bundles

With workflows, we could create bundle-specific workflows like:

**Example 1: Web Development Workflow**
`.agent/workflows/web-wizard-bundle.md`

- Loads: `frontend-design`, `react-best-practices`, `tailwind-patterns`
- Sequence: Design → Component Architecture → Styling → Testing
- Artifacts: Saves design tokens, component specs, style guide

**Example 2: Security Audit Workflow**
`.agent/workflows/security-audit-bundle.md`

- Loads: `ethical-hacking-methodology`, `vulnerability-scanner`, `security-auditor`
- Sequence: Recon → Scanning → Manual Testing → Report Generation
- Artifacts: Saves findings, severity ratings, remediation steps

### Integration with Current Setup

Currently, the skills can be integrated into `.agent/` at the root of a project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
```

With workflows support, the structure would be:

```
my-project/
├── .agent/
│   ├── skills/                    # Git cloned from this repo
│   │   ├── frontend-design/
│   │   ├── react-best-practices/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── workflows/                 # New: Bundle workflows
│       ├── web-wizard.md
│       ├── security-engineer.md
│       ├── startup-founder.md
│       └── ...
├── artifacts/                     # Generated by workflows
└── [my source code]
```

### Path Considerations

For workflows to reference skills correctly, we'd need to:

- Ensure correct relative paths from `.agent/workflows/` to `.agent/skills/`
- Document the expected directory structure in each workflow
- Provide helper scripts (like `write_artifact.py` in the reference repo) for common operations

### Proposed Workflow Implementation

For the bundles document you shared, we could have workflows like:

**# .agent/workflows/essentials-starter-pack.md**

Loads and orchestrates:

- `concise-planning` → Always plan first
- `lint-and-validate` → Check code quality
- `systematic-debugging` → Fix issues
- `git-pushing` → Commit changes
- `kaizen` → Continuous improvement

Each step verifies before moving to next.
This would make using bundles as simple as:

```bash
# In Antigravity
/essentials-starter-pack "Build a user authentication system"
```

Instead of manually invoking each skill one by one.

This structure aims to significantly improve the discoverability and usability of the massive library you've built. By providing these "shortcuts" for common routines, we make the entry point for new users much smoother while giving power users faster workflows.

What are your thoughts on this directory layout? I think it fits the "Awesome Skills" vision perfectly! 🚀

This proposal offers:

1. ✅ **Standardized Pathing** for the `.agent` setup
2. ✅ **Increased Speed** via bundle orchestration
3. ✅ **Cleaner Context** by loading groups of skills only when needed
4. ✅ **Better UX** for the end-user via single commands
