## 📚 How to Use Bundles

### 1) Pick by immediate goal

- Need to ship a feature now: `Essentials` + one domain pack (`Web Wizard`, `Python Pro`, `DevOps & Cloud`).
- Need reliability and hardening: add `QA & Testing` + `Security Developer`.
- Need product growth: add `Startup Founder` or `Marketing & Growth`.

### 2) Start with 3-5 skills, not 20

Pick the minimum set for your current milestone. Expand only when you hit a real gap.

### 3) Invoke skills consistently

- **Claude Code**: `>> /skill-name help me...`
- **Cursor**: `@skill-name` in chat
- **Gemini CLI**: `Use skill-name...`
- **Codex CLI**: `Use skill-name...`

### 4) Build your personal shortlist

Keep a small list of high-frequency skills and reuse it across tasks to reduce context switching.
